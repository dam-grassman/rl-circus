XRL Documentation !
===================


Needs for explainability and interpretability of machine learning algorithms have risen for the past few years,
especially when it comes to critical systems. Indeed, the trust in AI technology have become a real challenge in order to make
this brand new area accepted from professionals and the public. 

Whether an algorithm succeed and perform well or not on a test dataset is not longer 
enough to convince the non-tech companies to adopt such technology in production and thus, it has become a flourishing area of research over.

Reinforcement Learning makes no exception, especially as it benefits from black box technologies such as neural networks.
